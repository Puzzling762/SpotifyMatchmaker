Spotify Matchmaking App

This project is a matchmaking web application that leverages Spotifyâ€™s API to connect users based on their music preferences. Users can register, link their Spotify account, and retrieve their top artists and tracks. The app then finds potential matches by comparing music tastes (common artists and tracks) and generates a match score. If no match is found, users are notified with a "no match" message. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS templates.
